# Fortschritt

**Fortschritt** is a learning management system (LMS), whose backend is written mainly in PHP. This was in response to a project presentation for our group's Life Labs project, and is a prototype.

It is not recommended that this be used in production or in any public-facing website without significant changes, considering that many security-related measures were not implemented (i.e. password hashing, SQL injection, etc.).
